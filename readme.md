## Information
The site was built with the following technologies and languages:

## How to use a website
Must download the following node js and Angular to run the site
```

```
### After you have installed nodejs and Angular, you will do the following at the command prompt
`git clone https://github.com/ido4560/shoppingOnline.git` <br>
In the server folder run `npm install` and after run `nodemon` <br>
In the client folder run `npm install` too and after run `ng serve --open`<br>
